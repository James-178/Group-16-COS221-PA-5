I created the tables with mock data, not to sure about the delete conditions.
You should just be able to drag and drop the group16_movies.sql into phpMyAdmin and then boom databases.
If anyone feels like there is not enough data, feel free to add more.
Im unsure if there is a way to find a database/api with movie images to link to the titles table.
